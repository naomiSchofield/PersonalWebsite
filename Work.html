             <p class= linkDescription> The stray dog population in Beijing is a huge heartbreaking issue, so I decided
                 that rather than be sad every time I saw a stray (and try to convince my boyfriend we should adopt them) 
                 to start a charity called 'The Lost Puppies' as a charity we en route to rehoming 150 dogs.
